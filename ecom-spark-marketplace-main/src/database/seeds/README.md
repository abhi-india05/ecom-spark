# Database Seeds

This directory will contain seed data for development and testing.

Each seed file should focus on a specific entity type and include instructions for how to use it.

Example:
- `products.ts` - Seed data for products
- `users.ts` - Seed data for users
- `orders.ts` - Seed data for orders
